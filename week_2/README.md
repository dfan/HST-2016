# week_2
HST

1.	Please share the GitHub repo with your work. Include a README that gives an overview of the repo/directory structure.
2.	Please put your 3 paper write-ups for your Science Communication class in a folder in your GitHub repo.
3.	For your Incidentalome R/Shiny app:
(a) Read about ROC curves here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic
(b) Add user-inputtable parameters necessary to specify an ROC curve in its entirety, and plot an interactive ROC curve in your app that updates with parameter changes.
4.	Read about the nucleotide diversity measure here: http://www.pnas.org/content/76/10/5269.full.pdf
5.	Using the MYBPC3 and MYH7 ExAC data you downloaded & staged, can you compute nucleotide diversity? Why or why not?
6.	If you can, compute nucleotide diversity for all subpopulations in ExAC for MYBPC3 and MYH7. If you can’t, make a minimal set of (perhaps wrong but OK to be simple for now) assumptions necessary to compute nucleotide diversity, and do so for both genes, across all subpopulations. Plot.
7.	Commit all results and write-ups to GitHub.
