### Method 1: simulation by expected values
This method simply plots the expression $P(at least 1 false-positive) = 1-(1-false.positive.rate)^n$, which gives the expected value at each point.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
inputPanel(
  sliderInput("log10test","log10(No. of Independent Tests):",
                min = 1, max = 6, value = 4, step = 1),
  sliderInput("log10fpr","log10(False-Positive Rate):",
                min = -6, max = 0, value = -4, step = 1)
)
renderPlot({
  fpr <- 10^input$log10fpr
  test_num <- floor(seq(0,10^input$log10test,length.out = 150))[-1]
  plot(test_num, 1-(1-fpr)^test_num, main = "Figure. Percentage of Total Population with a False-Positive Test Result", 
       ylab = "Percentage of Total Population with a False-Positive Test Result", xlab = "No. of Independent Tests")
})
```
